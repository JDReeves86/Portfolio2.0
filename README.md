Welcome to my Portfolio! My portfolio is a Single Page Application built using React, Bulma, and some custom CSS styling. It is currently hosted on Netlify using Netlify Functions for nodemailer compatibility. 

There is a quick About section where you can read a little bit about my career in Healthcare and how I am in the process of making a career change. You will find a Projects section where you cna link to a few of my projects that I am proud to showcase and links to the GH repo, live applications, and some information about the projects. You will find the Contact section where you cna leave your information and send me a message. Finally, there are a few links to my LinkedIn page, GitHub page, my Resume, and a little surprise for the Dinosaur lovers in the world. 

Thanks for checking me out! If you want to get in touch about job opportunities please send me a message through my portfolio or through LinnkedIn!
